# Tweet Ideas - Setup Journey

## Tweet 1: Claude Code CLI Discovery
**Topic**: Tool choice and workflow

```
Just switched from Codex to Claude Code CLI and wow—this feels like actual pair programming vs just getting code snippets.

The conversational flow is *chef's kiss*

$20/month for Claude Pro = unlimited queries + Claude-4-Sonnet access. Pretty solid deal for AI-assisted development.

Anyone else tried this? How's your experience been?

## Tweet 2: Development Environment Flow  
**Topic**: Workflow optimization

```
Found my new favorite development flow:

• Claude Code CLI for AI collaboration in terminal
• Obsidian for formatted document viewing/editing
• Both can commit to git
• Changes sync in real-time between both

It's like having two different interfaces into the same project—command line for AI pairing, visual editor for human thinking.

Simple but effective.

## Tweet 3: Public/Private Repo Strategy
**Topic**: Knowledge management for builders

```
Experimenting with nested repos for a new project:

📂 Public repo: actual code, clean commits
📂 Private repo (nested): daily logs, messy thoughts, half-baked ideas

The private stuff is becoming great fodder for tweets and potential blog posts.

Thinking about using Obsidian Publish to share some of the journey publicly...

How do you organize your building-in-public content?

## Thread Option: Full Setup Story
**Topic**: Complete workflow evolution

```
1/ Spent today setting up a new development environment and stumbled into a workflow that feels really smooth...

2/ Switched from default macOS terminal to iTerm2. Amazing how much better readability matters for long coding sessions. 

(Tried Starship but it was overkill—iTerm2 strikes the right balance)

3/ Started using Claude Code CLI instead of Codex. The difference is night and day:
- Codex: Here's some code
- Claude Code: Let's think through this together

The conversational flow makes it feel like actual pair programming.

4/ The magic happens with Obsidian + Claude Code running simultaneously:
- AI collaboration in terminal
- Formatted docs in Obsidian
- Real-time sync between both
- Can commit from either place

It's like having two interfaces into the same brain.

5/ Also trying a nested repo strategy:
- Public: clean code and commits
- Private: messy thoughts and daily logs

The private notes are turning into good tweet material 👀

6/ Sometimes the setup is half the fun. What's your favorite development workflow discovery?
