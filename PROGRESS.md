## Phase 0 Status: ✅ FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE

**Success Criteria Review:**
- ✅ CLI answers test query correctly
- ⚠️ Response time: 51s (target <10s) - **Performance optimization needed**
- ✅ Cost: $0.216 (target <$0.50)
- ✅ Timeframe interpretation working
- ✅ Error handling functional
- ✅ Clear output format with structured insights

### Current Priority: Performance Optimization

**Current Issue:** E2E query takes 51 seconds (target: <10 seconds)
**Root Cause:** Sequential fetching of 50 conversation details (50+ API calls)

**Performance Baseline:**
- Query: "What are the top customer complaints this month?"
- Time: 51.0 seconds
- Cost: $0.216 (✅ under $0.50 target)
- Conversations: 50 analyzed
- Bottleneck: Intercom API conversation details fetching

**Optimization Plan:**

- [x] **Phase 1: Search API Migration** ✅ **COMPLETE** (target: 5-10s response)
  - ✅ Replaced `GET /conversations` + 50x `GET /conversations/{id}` pattern
  - ✅ Use `POST /conversations/search` with filters (50+ calls → 1 call)
  - ✅ **Actual improvement: 51s → 20.5s (60% faster, $0.216 → $0.070)**
  - ✅ Includes graceful fallback to old method if Search API fails

- [x] **Phase 2: Concurrent Processing** ✅ **MODERATE SUCCESS** (target: 3-7s response)
  - ✅ Added HTTP connection optimization with connection pooling
  - ✅ Improved async handling in conversation processing
  - ⚠️ **Limited improvement: 20.5s → ~20s (main bottlenecks are AI API calls)**
  - ✅ Architecture ready for more significant concurrent optimizations

- [ ] **Phase 3: Data Reduction** (target: 2-5s response) - **AI-FOCUSED APPROACH**
  - Remove system messages and admin-only conversations (no customer content)
  - Filter empty/low-value messages (e.g., auto-responses, single word replies)
  - Skip conversations with only admin activity (no customer interaction)
  - Use AI to identify and remove superfluous data rather than hardcoded heuristics
  - Preserve full conversation context for meaningful interactions
  - Expected improvement: 1-2 seconds saved from reduced token processing

- [ ] **Phase 4: Prompt Optimization** (target: 1-3s response)
  - Shorter, more focused prompts
  - Model selection based on query complexity
  - Pre-processing conversation summaries
  - Expected improvement: 1-2 seconds saved

2. Response time < 10 seconds consistently
3. Cost per query < $0.50
4. Handles timeframe interpretation correctly
5. Graceful error handling for API failures
6. Clear, actionable 3-5 bullet point output format

- python = "^3.11"
- openai = "^1.0.0"
- httpx = "^0.25.0"
- python-dotenv = "^1.0.0"
- pydantic = "^2.0.0"
- rich = "^13.0.0"

## Environment Variables Needed:
```bash
INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
MAX_CONVERSATIONS=50
DEBUG=false
```

## Current Session Context:
- Working on Phase 0 - Core Intelligence Proof
- Following implementation-specs.md for exact code structure
- Building CLI prototype to prove AI + MCP integration works
- Target: Functional CLI that can answer one question well

## Planned: Comprehensive Logging Strategy (Step 10)

**Logging Components to Implement:**
- **Structured logging** with JSON format for machine parsing
- **Performance metrics** (API response times, token usage, conversation processing time)
- **Error tracking** with context (API failures, parsing errors, validation failures)
- **Debug logging** for development (full request/response bodies when --debug)
- **Cost tracking** logs for budget monitoring
- **User activity** logs for usage analytics
- **Security logs** for API key validation and rate limiting

**Log Levels:**
- ERROR: API failures, validation errors, critical bugs
- WARN: Rate limiting, partial failures, fallbacks (MCP→REST)
- INFO: Query processing, performance metrics, cost tracking
- DEBUG: Full API payloads, detailed conversation parsing

**Log Destinations:**
- Console (formatted for human reading)
- File rotation for persistent debugging
- Future: Structured logs for monitoring systems

## NEXT AGENT HANDOFF: Phase 3 Implementation

**Current Status:** Phases 1 & 2 complete (51s → 20.5s improvement achieved)

**Next Task:** Implement Phase 3 Data Reduction (AI-focused approach)

**Key Implementation Areas:**
1. **Message filtering in `src/ai_client.py`**: Update `_build_analysis_prompt()` method to:
   - Skip messages where `author_type == "admin"` and no customer responses follow
   - Filter out empty messages or messages with `body` length < 10 characters
   - Remove auto-generated system messages (look for patterns in message content)

2. **Conversation filtering in `src/intercom_client.py`**: Add logic to:
   - Skip conversations with zero customer messages (admin-only threads)
   - Preserve conversations with meaningful customer-support interaction

3. **AI-driven filtering**: Use OpenAI to identify low-value content:
   - Pre-process conversations to identify auto-responses
   - Remove boilerplate/template messages
   - Maintain conversation context for analysis quality

**Target:** Reduce 20.5s response time to 15-18s through token reduction
**Files to modify:** `src/ai_client.py`, `src/intercom_client.py`
**Testing:** Run E2E test with same query to measure improvement
**Success criteria:** Maintain analysis quality while reducing processing time

---
**Last Updated:** Phase 3 plan revised with AI-focused approach, ready for next agent implementation
