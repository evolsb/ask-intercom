  - [x] Configured pyproject.toml with proper packages structure
  - [x] Installed all dependencies successfully
  - [x] Validated all imports work with dependencies
  - [x] Tested config validation with Pydantic

### More Completed Steps:
- [x] **Step 4: CLI Interface** (`src/cli.py`)
  - [x] Argparse configuration with help text and examples
  - [x] Rich console formatting for beautiful output
  - [x] Error handling and debug mode support
  - [x] Configuration override options (model, max-conversations)
- [x] **Step 5: Intercom Client** (`src/intercom_client.py`)
  - [x] REST API client with proper authentication
  - [x] Conversation fetching with date filters
  - [x] Message parsing and conversation structure
  - [x] MCP placeholder for future implementation
- [x] **Step 6: AI Client** (`src/ai_client.py`)
  - [x] OpenAI integration with cost tracking
  - [x] Timeframe interpretation with function calling
  - [x] Conversation analysis with structured prompts
  - [x] Cost calculation for multiple models
- [x] **Step 7: Query Processor** (`src/query_processor.py`)
  - [x] Complete workflow orchestration
  - [x] Error handling and performance logging
  - [x] Integration of all components

### More Completed Steps:
- [x] **Step 8: Testing Implementation**
  - [x] Unit tests for data models and config validation (13 tests passing)
  - [x] Integration tests with mocked API responses for AI client (11 tests passing)
  - [x] Test configuration and pytest setup working
  - [x] Cost calculation validation and edge cases
  - [x] Configuration validation with Pydantic V2
  - [x] Timeframe interpretation and insight extraction tests

**Test Coverage Summary:** 38 tests passing
- Models: 13 tests (TimeFrame, Message, Conversation, etc.)
- Config: 14 tests (validation, environment loading, edge cases)
- AI Client: 11 tests (timeframe parsing, cost calculation, analysis)

**Ready for Step 9: End-to-end Testing and Step 10: Logging**

### Remaining Phase 0 Steps:
- [ ] **Step 9: End-to-end Testing** (manual with real APIs)
- [ ] **Step 10: Logging Strategy Implementation** (planned)

## Success Criteria for Phase 0:
1. CLI answers "What are the top customer complaints this month?" correctly
2. Response time < 10 seconds consistently
3. Cost per query < $0.50
4. Handles timeframe interpretation correctly
5. Graceful error handling for API failures
6. Clear, actionable 3-5 bullet point output format

## Dependencies (pyproject.toml):
- python = "^3.11"
- openai = "^1.0.0"
- httpx = "^0.25.0"
- python-dotenv = "^1.0.0"
- pydantic = "^2.0.0"
- rich = "^13.0.0"

## Environment Variables Needed:
```bash
INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
MAX_CONVERSATIONS=50
DEBUG=false
```

## Current Session Context:
- Working on Phase 0 - Core Intelligence Proof
- Following implementation-specs.md for exact code structure
- Building CLI prototype to prove AI + MCP integration works
- Target: Functional CLI that can answer one question well

## Planned: Comprehensive Logging Strategy (Step 10)

**Logging Components to Implement:**
- **Structured logging** with JSON format for machine parsing
- **Performance metrics** (API response times, token usage, conversation processing time)
- **Error tracking** with context (API failures, parsing errors, validation failures)
- **Debug logging** for development (full request/response bodies when --debug)
- **Cost tracking** logs for budget monitoring
- **User activity** logs for usage analytics
- **Security logs** for API key validation and rate limiting

**Log Levels:**
- ERROR: API failures, validation errors, critical bugs
- WARN: Rate limiting, partial failures, fallbacks (MCP→REST)
- INFO: Query processing, performance metrics, cost tracking
- DEBUG: Full API payloads, detailed conversation parsing

**Log Destinations:**
- Console (formatted for human reading)
- File rotation for persistent debugging
- Future: Structured logs for monitoring systems

**Last Updated:** Phase 0 Steps 1-8 completed, 38 tests passing, ready for E2E testing
