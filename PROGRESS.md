- ✅ Clear output format with structured insights

**Key Achievement**: Functional CLI prototype proving AI + Intercom integration works

### Current Priority: MCP Integration (Phase 0.5)

**Strategic Shift**: Performance optimization + Universal Agent Architecture foundation  
**Current Status**: Planning MCP integration to achieve <10 second target  
**Next Target**: Dual-mode operation (REST + MCP) with cross-platform readiness

**Performance Progress:**
- Query: "What are the top customer complaints this month?"
- Baseline: 51.0 seconds, $0.216
- Phase 1 (Search API): 20.5s, $0.070 (60% improvement)
- Phase 3 (Compression): 30.2s, $0.087 (40% improvement from baseline)
- **Current Status: 40% performance improvement achieved**

**Optimization Plan:**

- [x] **Phase 1: Search API Migration** ✅ **COMPLETE** (target: 5-10s response)
  - ✅ Replaced `GET /conversations` + 50x `GET /conversations/{id}` pattern
  - ✅ Use `POST /conversations/search` with filters (50+ calls → 1 call)
  - ✅ **Actual improvement: 51s → 20.5s (60% faster, $0.216 → $0.070)**
  - ✅ Includes graceful fallback to old method if Search API fails

- [x] **Phase 2: Concurrent Processing** ✅ **MODERATE SUCCESS** (target: 3-7s response)
  - ✅ Added HTTP connection optimization with connection pooling
  - ✅ Improved async handling in conversation processing
  - ⚠️ **Limited improvement: 20.5s → ~20s (main bottlenecks are AI API calls)**
  - ✅ Architecture ready for more significant concurrent optimizations

- [x] **Phase 3: Data Reduction** ✅ **COMPLETE** (target: 15-18s response)
  - ✅ Implemented conversation compression that preserves context
  - ✅ Removed aggressive filtering that eliminated valuable customer responses
  - ✅ Created `_compress_conversation()` method that extracts key information
  - ✅ Preserves customer issues, responses (including "yes/no"), and resolutions
  - ✅ Maintains conversation context while reducing token usage
  - ✅ **Actual improvement: 51s → 30.2s (40% improvement from baseline)**

- [ ] **Phase 4: Safe Performance Optimization** (target: 20-25s response)
  - Prompt optimization (shorter, more focused prompts)
  - Model selection based on query complexity (gpt-3.5-turbo for simple queries)
  - Parallel AI processing for large datasets
  - Expected improvement: 5-10 seconds saved

## Strategic Architecture Evolution

### Phase 0.5: MCP Integration (CURRENT)
**Goal**: Achieve <10 second response time + Universal Agent foundation  
**Status**: Planning (see `docs/mcp/integration-plan.md`)  
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Value**: Performance + multi-platform readiness

### Phase 1: Universal Agent Skills Architecture  
**Goal**: Pluggable skills + cross-platform context management  
**Enables**: Multi-MCP support, skill-based analysis  
**Timeline**: Q3 2025

### Phase 2: Multi-Platform Intelligence
**Goal**: Slack MCP + cross-platform correlation  
**Enables**: Customer + internal team insights  
**Timeline**: Q4 2025

### Phase 3: Strategic Intelligence  
**Goal**: Linear MCP + strategic roadmap analysis  
**Enables**: "What should we deprioritize based on customer feedback?"  
**Timeline**: Q1 2026

### Phase 4: Agent Marketplace  
**Goal**: Universal Customer Intelligence Agent deployment  
**Enables**: Agent marketplace positioning, standardized MCP connections  
**Timeline**: Q2 2026

## Architectural Decisions Icebox

### ❄️ Deferred Optimizations
- **Local conversation caching**: Complex sync requirements, defer until MCP performance measured
- **Semantic deduplication**: Risk of losing insights, evaluate after universal agent implementation  
- **Two-stage AI analysis**: Quality concerns, investigate after cross-platform correlation needs
- **Advanced prompt optimization**: Diminishing returns, focus on MCP performance gains first

### ❄️ Alternative Architecture Approaches  
- **Multi-Agent Orchestra**: Rejected for Universal Agent (see `docs/architecture/universal-agent-design.md`)
- **FastAPI + Slack SDK approach**: Superseded by MCP-first strategy
- **Phase-by-phase REST API expansion**: Replaced by universal MCP approach
- **Custom integration patterns**: Standardized on MCP protocol for future-proofing

## Planned: Comprehensive Logging Strategy (Step 10)

**Logging Components to Implement:**
- **Structured logging** with JSON format for machine parsing
- **Performance metrics** (API response times, token usage, conversation processing time)
- **Error tracking** with context (API failures, parsing errors, validation failures)
- **Debug logging** for development (full request/response bodies when --debug)
- **Cost tracking** logs for budget monitoring
- **User activity** logs for usage analytics
- **Security logs** for API key validation and rate limiting

**Log Levels:**
- ERROR: API failures, validation errors, critical bugs
- WARN: Rate limiting, partial failures, fallbacks (MCP→REST)
- INFO: Query processing, performance metrics, cost tracking
- DEBUG: Full API payloads, detailed conversation parsing

**Log Destinations:**
- Console (formatted for human reading)
- File rotation for persistent debugging
- Future: Structured logs for monitoring systems
