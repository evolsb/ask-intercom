  - [x] Fixed Intercom conversation parsing (customer email extraction)
  - [x] Added 30s timeout to prevent httpx.ReadTimeout errors
  - [x] Results: 51s response time, $0.216 cost, 50 conversations analyzed
  - [x] Identified verification issues as top customer complaint

## Phase 0 Status: ✅ FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE

**Success Criteria Review:**
- ✅ CLI answers test query correctly
- ⚠️ Response time: 51s (target <10s) - **Performance optimization needed**
- ✅ Cost: $0.216 (target <$0.50)
- ✅ Timeframe interpretation working
- ✅ Error handling functional
- ✅ Clear output format with structured insights

### Current Priority: Performance Optimization

**Current Issue:** E2E query takes 51 seconds (target: <10 seconds)
**Root Cause:** Sequential fetching of 50 conversation details (50+ API calls)

**Performance Baseline:**
- Query: "What are the top customer complaints this month?"
- Time: 51.0 seconds
- Cost: $0.216 (✅ under $0.50 target)
- Conversations: 50 analyzed
- Bottleneck: Intercom API conversation details fetching

**Optimization Plan:**

- [ ] **Phase 1: Search API Migration** (target: 5-10s response)
  - Replace `GET /conversations` + 50x `GET /conversations/{id}` pattern
  - Use `POST /conversations/search` with filters (50+ calls → 1-2 calls)
  - Expected improvement: 40-45 seconds saved

- [ ] **Phase 2: Concurrent Processing** (target: 3-7s response)
  - Parallelize timeframe interpretation + conversation fetching
  - Add async.gather() for remaining sequential operations
  - Expected improvement: 3-5 seconds saved

- [ ] **Phase 3: Data Reduction** (target: 2-5s response)
  - Smart conversation sampling and filtering
  - Message type filtering (skip system messages)
  - Content truncation for AI prompts
  - Expected improvement: 1-2 seconds saved

- [ ] **Phase 4: Prompt Optimization** (target: 1-3s response)
  - Shorter, more focused prompts
  - Model selection based on query complexity
  - Pre-processing conversation summaries
  - Expected improvement: 1-2 seconds saved

2. Response time < 10 seconds consistently
3. Cost per query < $0.50
4. Handles timeframe interpretation correctly
5. Graceful error handling for API failures
6. Clear, actionable 3-5 bullet point output format

## Dependencies (pyproject.toml):

DEBUG=false
```

## Current Session Context:
- Working on Phase 0 - Core Intelligence Proof
- Following implementation-specs.md for exact code structure
- Building CLI prototype to prove AI + MCP integration works
- Target: Functional CLI that can answer one question well

## Planned: Comprehensive Logging Strategy (Step 10)

**Logging Components to Implement:**
- **Structured logging** with JSON format for machine parsing
- **Performance metrics** (API response times, token usage, conversation processing time)
- **Error tracking** with context (API failures, parsing errors, validation failures)
- **Debug logging** for development (full request/response bodies when --debug)
- **Cost tracking** logs for budget monitoring
- **User activity** logs for usage analytics
- **Security logs** for API key validation and rate limiting

**Log Levels:**
- ERROR: API failures, validation errors, critical bugs
- WARN: Rate limiting, partial failures, fallbacks (MCP→REST)
- INFO: Query processing, performance metrics, cost tracking
- DEBUG: Full API payloads, detailed conversation parsing

**Log Destinations:**
- Console (formatted for human reading)
- File rotation for persistent debugging
- Future: Structured logs for monitoring systems
