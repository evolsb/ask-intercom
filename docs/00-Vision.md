# Vision

> **Your always-on customer insights engine**

## Mission Statement

Transform customer conversations into product decisions. Start with Intercom analysis today, evolve into your complete customer intelligence platform tomorrow. Our AI agents turn feedback into prioritized roadmap items with real customer impact data - from initial insights to sprint-ready tickets.

## Current Focus: Ask-Intercom Foundation

**What we do today**: AI-powered analysis of Intercom conversations to surface customer complaints, feature requests, support issues, and sentiment trends through natural language queries.

**Why we started here**: Intercom contains the richest customer conversation data, making it the perfect foundation for understanding customer needs and building robust AI analysis capabilities.

## Expanded Vision: Complete Customer Intelligence Platform

**Where we're heading**: Your always-on customer insights engine that connects all feedback sources (Intercom, Zendesk, Canny) with AI agents that assess customer feedback in real-time and turn it into actionable roadmap items: bugs, feature requests, long-term vision - tied to real customer data with impact assessment. Connect your product roadmapping tools (Linear, Jira, Asana) and we create tickets ready for your sprints.
