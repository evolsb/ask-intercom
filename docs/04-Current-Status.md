## 🎯 Recent Major Changes

### v0.4: Docker Deployment (✅ COMPLETED)
**What Changed**:
- ✅ **Docker setup complete**: Multi-stage build (Node.js → Python) with single container
- ✅ **One-command deployment**: `docker-compose up` handles everything
- ✅ **Production ready**: Health checks, security, proper permissions, non-root user
- ✅ **Documentation updated**: Clear setup instructions for developers
- ✅ **Environment template**: Comprehensive .env.example with helpful comments
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with Docker build testing
- ✅ **End-to-end tested**: Full Docker deployment validated and working
- ✅ **Build issues resolved**: Frontend TypeScript and Poetry 2.x compatibility fixed

**Why**: Enable easy deployment for developers and prepare foundation for hosted version.

### v0.3: Smart Limits Removal (Previously Completed)
**What Changed**:
- ✅ **Removed all smart limit logic** from backend and frontend
- ✅ **Added optional manual limits** via Settings modal
- ✅ **Default behavior**: No conversation limits (fetches all conversations in timeframe)
- ✅ **User control**: Can set custom limits up to 1000 via Settings button

**Why**: Smart limits were overriding user intent (e.g., "24 hours" would fetch 30 days). Now system respects exact timeframes.

### v0.2: Web Interface (Previously Completed)
- ✅ FastAPI backend with streaming responses
- ✅ React frontend with real-time progress tracking  
- ✅ Server-Sent Events for live updates
- ✅ Complete UI redesign with shadcn/ui components

### v0.1: CLI Prototype (Previously Completed)  
- ✅ Basic query processing and AI analysis
- ✅ Intercom API integration
- ✅ Cost optimization and performance baseline

## 📊 Current Performance

**Response Times**:
- Small queries (10-50 conversations): 10-30 seconds
- Medium queries (100-200 conversations): 30-60 seconds  
- Large queries (500+ conversations): 60-120 seconds

**Costs** (per query):
- ~$0.004 per conversation analyzed
- ~$0.01 base cost for timeframe interpretation
- Typical query: $0.05-$0.50 depending on conversation count

**Reliability**:
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Rate limiting compliance (Intercom API)
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms for AI parsing failures

## 🔧 Known Issues

### Minor Issues
- **Frontend Tests**: TypeScript errors in test files (app works fine)
- **Build Warnings**: Some development warnings (non-blocking)

### Limitations  
- **Single Platform**: Currently Intercom-only
- **Local Deployment**: Not yet hosted (coming in next iteration)
- **Basic Analytics**: Limited usage tracking

## 🏗️ Current Architecture State

```
React Frontend ←→ FastAPI Backend ←→ QueryProcessor
       ↓                ↓               ↓
   User Settings    Session Mgmt    AI + Intercom
```

**What's Solid**:
- ✅ Core query processing pipeline
- ✅ Real-time progress updates  
- ✅ Structured data flow (AI → JSON → Frontend)
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ User-controlled conversation limits

**What's Simple**:
- No complex configurations required
- Direct timeframe interpretation (no overrides)
- Optional settings for power users
- Clean separation of concerns

## 🎯 MCP-Only Architecture Status

**✅ COMPLETED**: MCP-only universal agent architecture with FastIntercomMCP integration

### What's Working
- **MCP-only design**: Universal agent speaks only MCP protocol - no mixed protocol handling
- **FastIntercomMCP integration**: High-performance caching backend as primary choice
- **3-tier backend priority**: FastIntercomMCP → Official Intercom MCP → Local MCP wrapper
- **Configuration-driven**: `MCP_BACKEND=fastintercom|official|local` environment setting
- **Package-ready**: FastIntercomMCP as installable Python package dependency
- **Railway deployment**: Docker configuration updated for FastIntercomMCP package

### Architecture Achievements
- **Simplified protocol**: Single MCP interface for all backends
- **FastIntercomMCP priority**: 400x speedup potential with intelligent caching
- **Future-proof foundation**: Ready for multi-platform expansion (Slack, Linear, etc.)
- **Clean fallback chain**: Graceful degradation between MCP implementations
- **Deployment ready**: Package-based architecture suitable for production

### Testing MCP Backend Performance
```bash
# Test Local MCP (baseline)
time env ENABLE_MCP=true MCP_BACKEND=local poetry run python -m src.cli "show me issues from today"

# Test FastIntercomMCP (high-performance)
time env ENABLE_MCP=true MCP_BACKEND=fastintercom poetry run python -m src.cli "show me issues from today"

# Check backend selection
python -c "
from src.config import Config
config = Config.from_env()
print(f'MCP enabled: {config.enable_mcp}')
print(f'Backend: {config.mcp_backend}')
"
```

### Current Status
- **✅ Architecture**: MCP-only universal agent implemented
- **✅ FastIntercomMCP**: Package integration complete with caching backend
- **✅ Configuration**: Simplified MCP_BACKEND selection (fastintercom|official|local)
- **✅ Deployment**: Railway/Docker ready with package dependencies
- **✅ Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for MCP-only architecture
- **✅ Fallback**: Clean degradation chain between MCP implementations

### Next Steps (Production & Enhancement)

#### Ready for Merge to Main
- **✅ MCP-only architecture**: Complete and tested
- **✅ FastIntercomMCP integration**: Package-ready deployment
- **✅ Simplified configuration**: Clean MCP_BACKEND selection
- **✅ Railway deployment**: Updated for production

#### Post-Merge Priorities
1. **FastIntercomMCP package**: Publish FastIntercomMCP as installable package
2. **Performance benchmarking**: Measure FastIntercomMCP vs Local MCP performance
3. **Multi-platform expansion**: Add Slack, Linear MCP adapters using same pattern
4. **Enhanced MCP features**: Leverage streaming, semantic search when available

#### Future Enhancements  
5. **User-specific authentication**: Replace developer tokens with per-user auth
6. **Agent marketplace**: Package as universal customer intelligence agent
7. **Advanced caching**: Optimize FastIntercomMCP cache strategies
