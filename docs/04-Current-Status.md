# Current Status

> **What works now and recent changes**

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- **CLI Tool**: Fully functional command-line interface
- **Web Application**: React frontend + FastAPI backend deployed locally
- **AI Analysis**: OpenAI GPT-4 integration with structured JSON output
- **Real-time Progress**: Server-Sent Events with live progress updates
- **Conversation Fetching**: Intercom API integration with pagination
- **Docker Deployment**: Production-ready containerization with one-command setup, tested end-to-end

### User Experience
- **Natural Language Queries**: "show me issues from last 24 hours"

- **Structured Insights**: Customer details, priority scores, categories
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery with user-friendly messages
- **Responsive UI**: Clean shadcn/ui design with dark mode support

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive debugging with JSON logs
- **Session Management**: Request tracking and performance monitoring
- **Global Exception Handling**: Proper error responses and logging
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs
- **Production Ready**: Docker containerization with health checks, proper security, and permissions
- **Environment Management**: Clean .env configuration with helpful templates
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with automated testing and Docker validation
- **Developer Experience**: Bulletproof one-command deployment (`docker-compose up`)

## 🎯 Recent Major Changes

### v0.4: Docker Deployment (✅ COMPLETED)
**What Changed**:
- ✅ **Docker setup complete**: Multi-stage build (Node.js → Python) with single container
- ✅ **One-command deployment**: `docker-compose up` handles everything
- ✅ **Production ready**: Health checks, security, proper permissions, non-root user
- ✅ **Documentation updated**: Clear setup instructions for developers
- ✅ **Environment template**: Comprehensive .env.example with helpful comments
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with Docker build testing
- ✅ **End-to-end tested**: Full Docker deployment validated and working
- ✅ **Build issues resolved**: Frontend TypeScript and Poetry 2.x compatibility fixed

**Why**: Enable easy deployment for developers and prepare foundation for hosted version.

### v0.3: Smart Limits Removal (Previously Completed)
**What Changed**:
- ✅ **Removed all smart limit logic** from backend and frontend
- ✅ **Added optional manual limits** via Settings modal
- ✅ **Default behavior**: No conversation limits (fetches all conversations in timeframe)
- ✅ **User control**: Can set custom limits up to 1000 via Settings button

**Why**: Smart limits were overriding user intent (e.g., "24 hours" would fetch 30 days). Now system respects exact timeframes.

### v0.2: Web Interface (Previously Completed)
- ✅ FastAPI backend with streaming responses
- ✅ React frontend with real-time progress tracking  
- ✅ Server-Sent Events for live updates
- ✅ Complete UI redesign with shadcn/ui components

### v0.1: CLI Prototype (Previously Completed)  
- ✅ Basic query processing and AI analysis
- ✅ Intercom API integration
- ✅ Cost optimization and performance baseline

## 📊 Current Performance

**Response Times**:
- Small queries (10-50 conversations): 10-30 seconds
- Medium queries (100-200 conversations): 30-60 seconds  
- Large queries (500+ conversations): 60-120 seconds

**Costs** (per query):
- ~$0.004 per conversation analyzed
- ~$0.01 base cost for timeframe interpretation
- Typical query: $0.05-$0.50 depending on conversation count

**Reliability**:
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Rate limiting compliance (Intercom API)
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms for AI parsing failures

## 🔧 Known Issues

### Minor Issues
- **Frontend Tests**: TypeScript errors in test files (app works fine)
- **Build Warnings**: Some development warnings (non-blocking)

### Limitations  
- **Single Platform**: Currently Intercom-only
- **Local Deployment**: Not yet hosted (coming in next iteration)
- **Basic Analytics**: Limited usage tracking

## 🏗️ Current Architecture State

```
React Frontend ←→ FastAPI Backend ←→ QueryProcessor
       ↓                ↓               ↓
   User Settings    Session Mgmt    AI + Intercom
```

**What's Solid**:
- ✅ Core query processing pipeline
- ✅ Real-time progress updates  
- ✅ Structured data flow (AI → JSON → Frontend)
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ User-controlled conversation limits

**What's Simple**:
- No complex configurations required
- Direct timeframe interpretation (no overrides)
- Optional settings for power users
- Clean separation of concerns
