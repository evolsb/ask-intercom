# Archive: Old Documentation

This folder contains the previous documentation structure that used "phase" numbering and complex organization.

## What Was Moved Here

- `planning/` - Old roadmap and phase-based planning
- `implementation/` - Phase 0.5 parallel development docs  
- `architecture/` - Phase 0 architecture documents
- `vision/` - Original vision and strategy docs
- `reference/` - Old technical reference materials
- `index.md` - Previous documentation hub

## Why It Was Archived

The old structure had several issues:
- Confusing "phase 0.5" and "phase 0" numbering
- Complex nested organization
- Outdated information (smart limits, parallel tracks)
- Hard to find specific information
- Too much planning, not enough current state

## New Structure

The new simplified documentation is in the root `docs/` folder:
- `01-README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `02-Setup.md` - Development environment setup  
- `03-Architecture.md` - System design
- `04-Current-Status.md` - What works now
- `05-Next-Steps.md` - Future plans
- `06-Decisions.md` - Technical choices made

This new structure is:
- Numbered for easy navigation and sorting
- Focused on current state vs future plans
- Simple and practical
- Easy to maintain
