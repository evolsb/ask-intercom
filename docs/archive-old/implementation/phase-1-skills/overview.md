# Phase 1: Universal Agent Skills Architecture

> **Status**: Future phase - high-level planning only  
> **Goal**: Transform monolithic CLI into Universal Agent with pluggable skills  
> **Timeline**: After Phase 0.5 complete (~Q3 2025)

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Skills Architecture**: Extract current functionality into pluggable skills
2. **MCP Registry**: Multi-platform connection management foundation
3. **Cross-Platform Context**: Unified data model for future integrations
4. **Universal Agent Foundation**: Prepare for Slack and Linear MCP integration

### Success Criteria
- Current CLI functionality preserved but architected as skills
- Easy to add new skills without changing core agent
- MCP registry supports multiple platform connections
- Cross-platform context management working
- Foundation ready for Phase 2 (Slack MCP integration)

## ðŸ§© Skills to Extract

### Core Skills Framework
```python
class UniversalCustomerAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mcp_registry = MCPRegistry()      # Multi-platform connections
        self.skill_registry = SkillRegistry()  # Pluggable capabilities
        self.context_manager = CrossPlatformContextManager()
```

### Skills to Build
- **TimeframeSkill**: Date parsing and interpretation (already mostly done)
- **ConversationSkill**: Fetching and filtering conversations
- **SentimentSkill**: Analysis of customer sentiment 
- **TrendSkill**: Pattern detection and trend analysis
- **InsightSkill**: Synthesis and recommendation generation

## ðŸ”— Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- âœ… Phase 0.5 MCP integration complete
- âœ… Performance <10s target achieved  
- âœ… Dual-mode operation (REST + MCP) stable
- âœ… Universal Agent architecture validated

### Blockers
- Phase 0.5 must complete successfully
- Need to validate MCP approach before building multi-platform foundation

## ðŸš€ Preparation Work

### Architecture Research
- Study skill-based agent frameworks
- Research cross-platform context management patterns
- Plan MCP registry design for multiple connections

### Code Preparation  
- Identify clean extraction points in current codebase
- Design skill interfaces and base classes
- Plan migration strategy from monolithic to skills

*This is high-level planning only. Detailed tasks and progress tracking will be created when Phase 0.5 nears completion.*

**Note**: Focus on Phase 0.5 first - this phase planning will be detailed just-in-time as we approach it.
