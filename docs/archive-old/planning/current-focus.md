## 🔥 Active Work: Phase 0.5 Parallel Development

**Two parallel tracks** - choose based on what needs to be de-risked next!

### 🚀 Track A: MCP Integration
**Goal**: <10 second response time + Universal Agent foundation  
**Branch**: `main` or `feature/mcp-integration`  
**Focus**: Performance optimization, architecture foundation

### 🌐 Track B: Web Deployment  
**Goal**: Transform CLI into shareable web app  
**Branch**: `feature/web-deployment`  
**Focus**: User accessibility, rapid feedback loops

### 🎯 Current Session Focus
✅ **COMPLETED**: Major AI output restructuring with JSON schema  
🎯 **Next**: Enhanced real-time progress updates and production polish  
✅ **Completed This Session**: 
- ✅ **Structured JSON AI Output**: Eliminated 140+ lines of fragile regex parsing
- ✅ **New API Endpoint**: `/api/analyze/structured` returns clean JSON data
- ✅ **Enhanced Data Models**: Priority scores, severity levels, customer details
- ✅ **Updated Frontend**: Direct consumption of structured insights
- ✅ **Fallback Mechanism**: Graceful degradation to legacy parsing if needed
- ✅ **Improved UI**: Better badges, priority scores, severity indicators
- ✅ **Customer Experience**: Cleaner data → no more title duplication or parsing errors
- Previous UI improvements maintained:
  - Complete shadcn UI redesign with proper layout consistency
  - Fixed card implementation with proper titles and typography  
  - Added copy-to-clipboard functionality with elegant split buttons
  - Customer emails as button text, combined view/copy buttons

### 🧠 Mental Context
- Phase 0 CLI prototype complete (30.2s response time)
- Web app UI redesign complete with clean shadcn implementation
- ✅ **SOLVED**: Text parsing issues completely eliminated
- ✅ **AI Overhaul Complete**: Structured JSON output implemented end-to-end
- Clean data flow: AI → JSON → Frontend (no parsing layer needed)
- Both legacy and structured APIs available for migration safety

### 🚧 Priority Order

1. ✅ **COMPLETED: Structured AI Output** 
   - ✅ Implemented JSON schema for AI responses
   - ✅ Eliminated 140+ lines of fragile regex parsing  
   - ✅ Direct data consumption in frontend
   - ✅ Fallback to legacy approach for safety
   
2. ✅ **COMPLETED: Enhanced Real-time Progress** (user experience)
   - ✅ Added progress callback mechanism to QueryProcessor  
   - ✅ Implemented granular progress stages with conversation counts
   - ✅ Fixed scroll-jump issue in collapsible analysis cards
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Frontend SSE consumption and real-time updates
   - ✅ Progress state management in Zustand store
   - ✅ Real-time progress bar updates during analysis
   - ✅ **Enhanced Fetching Progress**: Added pagination feedback ("Fetched X/Y conversations")
   - ✅ **SSE Structured Data**: Updated streaming endpoint to preserve rich analysis cards
   - ✅ **Deprecated Legacy Endpoints**: Moved to structured format for all responses
   - ✅ **Improved Progress Messages**: More informative stages with model info
   - ✅ **Added Finalizing Stage**: Shows post-AI processing steps
   - ✅ **Better Timing**: Realistic progress updates every 1-4 seconds
   - ✅ **Dynamic Real-time Progress**: Replaced static simulation with actual progress tracking
   - ✅ **Smart AI Estimation**: Progress bar moves continuously based on conversation count
   - ✅ **Improved Summary Display**: Shows "X insights from Y conversations" instead of confusing message counts
   - ✅ **Accurate Finalizing**: No more long "saving results" delays

3. **Production Polish** (after core functionality solid)
   - Advanced debugging infrastructure
   - MCP integration for performance  
   - Export capabilities and analytics

## 📋 What's Coming After This Focus

**Phase 1**: Universal Agent Skills Architecture
- Transform monolithic CLI into pluggable skills
- Enable multi-MCP platform support (Slack, Linear)
- Cross-platform intelligence queries
