# Documentation Archive

> **Historical documentation files** - content has been preserved in the new schema

## üìÇ Archived Files

### `PROGRESS.md` (archived 2025-06-18)
**Original location**: Root directory  
**Why archived**: Old progress tracking format that mixed completed work with future plans  
**Content preserved in**:
- `docs/planning/current-focus.md` - Current work and next steps
- `docs/planning/roadmap.md` - Strategic timeline and phases
- `docs/implementation/phase-0.5-mcp/progress.md` - MCP implementation status
- `docs/reference/decisions.md` - ADR-004 documenting performance optimization decisions

### `build-progression.md` (archived 2025-06-18)  
**Original location**: `docs/build-progression.md`  
**Why archived**: Risk-first development approach superseded by Universal Agent architecture  
**Content preserved in**:
- `docs/planning/roadmap.md` - Updated phase structure and timeline
- `docs/planning/icebox.md` - Deferred optimization approaches
- `docs/reference/decisions.md` - Architectural decision rationale
- `docs/vision/architecture.md` - Universal Agent strategic direction

### `implementation-specs.md` (archived 2025-06-18)
**Original location**: `docs/architecture/implementation-specs.md`  
**Why archived**: Detailed Phase 0 implementation guide now complete  
**Content preserved in**:
- `docs/reference/setup-guide.md` - Development environment setup
- `docs/architecture/phase-0-architecture.md` - Phase 0 architectural reference (kept)
- Current codebase in `src/` - Actual implementation

## üîÑ Content Migration Summary

All important content from archived files has been:
1. **Migrated** to appropriate locations in the new schema
2. **Updated** to reflect current status and Universal Agent architecture  
3. **Reorganized** for vibe-coding workflow (energy-based, flexible timeline)

## üìö New Schema Benefits

The archived files had several issues resolved by the new structure:
- **Mixed timeframes**: Past achievements mixed with future plans
- **Outdated architecture**: Pre-Universal Agent decision content
- **Rigid timeline**: Week-based planning not suitable for solo development
- **Scattered information**: Related content in multiple files

## üóÉÔ∏è Access Pattern

These files are preserved for:
- **Historical reference** - Understanding past decisions and context
- **Decision archaeology** - Seeing how architecture evolved
- **Learning from attempts** - What worked and what didn't
