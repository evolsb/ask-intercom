# Phase 0.5 Web Deployment Tasks

> **Transform CLI into shareable web app** - organized by energy and complexity

## ðŸŸ¢ Quick Wins (Good for low-energy sessions)

### Project Setup
- [ ] Create `frontend/` directory structure
- [ ] Initialize React app with Vite
- [ ] Set up basic FastAPI app structure
- [ ] Create Docker configuration files
- [ ] Add web dependencies to `pyproject.toml`

### Static Pages & Content
- [ ] Create landing page with value proposition
- [ ] Write copy for "How it works" section
- [ ] Design simple about page
- [ ] Create error pages (404, 500)
- [ ] Write basic documentation for web version

### Configuration & Environment
- [ ] Set up environment variables for web app
- [ ] Create production/development configs
- [ ] Configure CORS settings
- [ ] Set up basic logging for web requests

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Work (Need moderate focus)

### React Frontend Components
- [ ] Build query input form component
- [ ] Create analysis results display component
- [ ] Design API key management interface
- [ ] Implement query history functionality
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling

### FastAPI Backend Integration
- [ ] Create API endpoints wrapping CLI logic
- [ ] Implement request/response models
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Create health check and status endpoints
- [ ] Set up basic rate limiting

### UI/UX Design
- [ ] Design responsive layout
- [ ] Create consistent styling system
- [ ] Implement dark/light mode toggle
- [ ] Add mobile-friendly interface
- [ ] Design query result visualizations

## ðŸ”´ Deep Work (Need focus time and high energy)

### Backend Architecture
- [ ] Integrate existing CLI logic into FastAPI
- [ ] Implement async request handling
- [ ] Create secure API key handling
- [ ] Design session management system
- [ ] Build robust error handling and logging

### Frontend State Management
- [ ] Set up React state management (Context/Redux)
- [ ] Implement query result caching
- [ ] Create persistent user preferences
- [ ] Build real-time query status updates
- [ ] Design complex UI interactions

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement query sharing functionality
- [ ] Build export capabilities (CSV, JSON, PDF)
- [ ] Create usage analytics dashboard
- [ ] Add collaborative features (team queries)
- [ ] Design admin interface for monitoring

## ðŸš§ Blockers & Research

### Technical Research
- [ ] **Choose UI framework**: React vs Vue vs Svelte
- [ ] **Pick hosting platform**: Railway vs Vercel vs custom
- [ ] **Database decisions**: SQLite vs PostgreSQL for query history
- [ ] **Authentication strategy**: Simple API keys vs OAuth

### External Dependencies
- [ ] Frontend build and deployment pipeline
- [ ] SSL certificate and domain setup
- [ ] CDN configuration for static assets
- [ ] Monitoring and analytics setup

## ðŸ”„ Parallel Work (Independent of other tasks)

### DevOps & Deployment
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure automated testing
- [ ] Create staging environment
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Document deployment process

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Write frontend unit tests
- [ ] Create API integration tests
- [ ] Set up end-to-end testing
- [ ] Add accessibility testing
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization

### Documentation & Marketing
- [ ] Create user onboarding flow
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Design demo videos/screenshots
- [ ] Prepare launch announcement
- [ ] Set up feedback collection

## ðŸ“± Web Development Phases (from original strategy)

### Phase 1: Self-Hosted Web App (Weeks 1-2)
**Target**: Docker-deployable web version for developers
- FastAPI backend wrapping CLI logic
- React frontend with query interface
- One-command Docker deployment
- GitHub repo with comprehensive README

### Phase 2: Hosted SaaS Experience (Weeks 3-4)  
**Target**: Public hosted version for non-technical users
- Cloud deployment (Railway/Vercel)
- API key management in browser
- Query history and sharing
- Landing page with clear value prop

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
**Target**: Production-ready with advanced capabilities
- Export functions (CSV, JSON, email)
- Usage analytics and monitoring
- Team collaboration features
- A/B testing for UX optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Selection Strategy

**High Energy**: Backend architecture, complex React state management  
**Medium Energy**: UI components, API endpoints, styling  
**Low Energy**: Static pages, configuration, documentation  
**Variety Mode**: Switch to MCP track when you want different challenges!

**Branch Strategy**: Work on `feature/web-deployment` branch, merge when phases complete
