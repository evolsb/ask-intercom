# Phase 0.5 Web Deployment Tasks

> **Transform CLI into shareable web app** - prioritized by risk and dependencies

## Core Infrastructure (De-risk first)

### Project Setup
- [ ] Create `frontend/` directory structure
- [ ] Initialize React app with Vite
- [ ] Set up basic FastAPI app structure
- [ ] Create Docker configuration files
- [ ] Add web dependencies to `pyproject.toml`

### Backend Architecture
- [ ] Integrate existing CLI logic into FastAPI
- [ ] Implement async request handling
- [ ] Create secure API key handling with localStorage support
- [ ] Design session management system
- [ ] Build comprehensive logging system (30-day retention)

### Real-Time Updates (SSE)
- [ ] Implement Server-Sent Events endpoint
- [ ] Create progress streaming for long-running queries
- [ ] Handle connection drops and reconnection
- [ ] Test with 20-30 second query times

## API Development

### FastAPI Endpoints
- [ ] Create API endpoints wrapping CLI logic
- [ ] Implement request/response models
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Create health check and status endpoints
- [ ] Set up basic rate limiting

### Authentication & Security
- [ ] Implement dual-mode authentication (env vars for Docker, localStorage for SaaS)
- [ ] Create API key validation middleware
- [ ] Set up CORS configuration
- [ ] Implement request logging for learning

## Frontend Development

### React + Vite Setup
- [ ] Configure Vite build pipeline
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Set up Zustand for state management
- [ ] Configure development proxy to backend

### Core Components
- [ ] Build API key setup component (localStorage)
- [ ] Create query input form component
- [ ] Implement SSE progress display component
- [ ] Create analysis results display component
- [ ] Add error boundary and fallback UI

### User Experience
- [ ] Design responsive layout
- [ ] Implement loading states with SSE progress
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Create mobile-friendly interface
- [ ] Add privacy disclaimer (30-day data retention)

## Advanced Features

### Data & Analytics
- [ ] Implement comprehensive request/response logging
- [ ] Create 30-day auto-deletion for logs
- [ ] Build usage analytics dashboard
- [ ] Track query patterns and insights

### Export & Sharing
- [ ] Implement query sharing functionality
- [ ] Build export capabilities (CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Create persistent query history
- [ ] Add result caching in browser

## Deployment & Operations

### Docker Configuration
- [ ] Create multi-stage Dockerfile
- [ ] Set up docker-compose for local development
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test one-command deployment

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Choose and configure hosting platform (Railway/Vercel)
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerts

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Write API integration tests
- [ ] Create frontend component tests
- [ ] Set up end-to-end testing
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test with real 20-30s queries

### Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Write deployment guide
- [ ] Document authentication flows
- [ ] Create user onboarding flow

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Working web app with core functionality
- FastAPI backend with SSE support
- React + Vite frontend with localStorage auth
- Docker deployment ready
- Basic query â†’ results flow working

### Phase 2: Production Ready (Weeks 3-4)  
**Goal**: Hosted SaaS with full features
- Cloud deployment live
- Comprehensive logging implemented
- Export and sharing features
- Performance optimized for 20-30s queries

### Phase 3: Growth Features (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Enhanced user experience
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Team collaboration features
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Marketplace preparation

## Technical Decisions Made

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Zustand + Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Auth**: localStorage for SaaS, env vars for Docker
- **Logging**: Comprehensive with 30-day retention
- **Deployment**: Docker + Cloud (Railway/Vercel)

**Branch Strategy**: Work on `feature/web-deployment` branch, merge when phases complete
