# Phase 0.5 Web Deployment Progress

> **Web app development status** - track frontend and backend progress

## 🔥 Current Vibe
**Working on**: Documentation setup → Ready to start web development  
**Next**: Choose between React setup OR FastAPI backend setup  
**Blocked on**: Nothing - comprehensive plan ready to execute!  

## 📊 Overall Progress
- **Planning**: ✅ Complete (comprehensive strategy document)
- **Project Setup**: ⏳ Not started
- **Backend**: ⏳ Not started  
- **Frontend**: ⏳ Not started
- **Deployment**: ⏳ Not started

## ✅ Recently Completed
- ✅ Comprehensive web deployment strategy created
- ✅ Identified dual-track approach (self-hosted + SaaS)
- ✅ Defined clear user personas and use cases
- ✅ Planned 3-phase implementation roadmap
- ✅ Integrated with parallel MCP development approach

## 🔄 Currently Working On
- Setting up new documentation structure
- Planning parallel development with MCP track

## 🎯 Next Session Plans

### Phase 1 Kickoff Options (Pick based on energy)
1. **Frontend Focus**: Set up React app with Vite, create basic components
2. **Backend Focus**: Create FastAPI app structure, wrap CLI logic
3. **DevOps Focus**: Set up Docker configuration and CI/CD pipeline

### Immediate Decision Points
- **UI Framework**: React (recommended) vs Vue vs Svelte
- **Hosting Platform**: Railway vs Vercel vs custom setup
- **Development Approach**: Frontend-first vs Backend-first vs Parallel

## 🚧 Key Considerations

### Technical Decisions Needed
- How to integrate existing CLI logic into FastAPI backend
- State management approach for React frontend
- API key security and session management
- Database choice for query history and user data

### User Experience Priorities
- **Phase 1**: Developer-friendly Docker deployment
- **Phase 2**: Non-technical user onboarding with API keys
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features like sharing and exports

## 🧠 Strategic Context
- **Parallel Development**: Can work on web while MCP track handles performance
- **User Validation**: Web app enables immediate team testing and feedback
- **Market Opportunity**: Bridges CLI prototype to SaaS product
- **Universal Agent Prep**: Web interface will showcase cross-platform capabilities

## ⚡ Energy & Mood Matching

### 🟢 High Energy Sessions
- Architecture decisions (backend integration, state management)
- Complex React components with interactive features
- Authentication and security implementation

### 🟡 Medium Energy Sessions  
- UI component development and styling
- API endpoint creation and testing
- Database schema design and migrations

### 🔴 Low Energy Sessions
- Static page content and copy writing
- Configuration file setup
- Documentation and README updates

### 🎮 When You Want Variety
- Switch to MCP track for backend research and architecture work
- Alternative between frontend (visual) and backend (logical) tasks
