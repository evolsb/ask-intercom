# Phase 0.5 MCP Integration Tasks

> **Organized by energy level and complexity** - pick tasks based on your current vibe

## ðŸŸ¢ Quick Wins (Good for low-energy sessions)

### Configuration & Setup
- [ ] Add MCP config fields to `src/config.py`
  ```python
  enable_mcp: bool = Field(default=False)
  mcp_server_url: str = Field(default="https://mcp.intercom.com/sse")
  mcp_oauth_token: str = Field(default="")
  ```
- [ ] Create basic `src/mcp_client.py` file structure
- [ ] Update `.env.example` with MCP environment variables
- [ ] Add MCP dependencies to `pyproject.toml`

### Documentation & Tests
- [ ] Write unit tests for MCP config validation
- [ ] Create MCP integration test stubs
- [ ] Update CLI help text to mention MCP mode
- [ ] Document MCP setup process

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Work (Need moderate focus)

### MCP Client Foundation
- [ ] Research and select MCP client library
- [ ] Implement basic MCP connection management
- [ ] Create health monitoring for MCP connection
- [ ] Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff

### Integration Points
- [ ] Update `src/intercom_client.py` for dual-mode operation
- [ ] Create graceful fallback mechanism (MCP â†’ REST)
- [ ] Add logging for mode selection and performance
- [ ] Implement MCP connection status checking

### Data Transformation
- [ ] Map `ConversationFilters` to MCP parameters
- [ ] Convert MCP responses to `Conversation` objects
- [ ] Ensure data parity with REST API responses
- [ ] Handle missing fields gracefully

## ðŸ”´ Deep Work (Need focus time and high energy)

### MCP Authentication
- [ ] Implement OAuth flow for MCP authentication
- [ ] Create secure token storage and refresh mechanism
- [ ] Handle MCP authentication errors and recovery
- [ ] Test authentication with real Intercom MCP server

### Conversation Fetching via MCP
- [ ] Implement `search-conversations` MCP tool calls
- [ ] Build conversation streaming functionality
- [ ] Create parallel conversation processing
- [ ] Optimize MCP request/response handling

### Performance & Benchmarking
- [ ] Create comprehensive MCP vs REST performance tests
- [ ] Implement automated benchmarking suite
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Validate <10 second response time target

## ðŸš§ Blockers & Research

### Research Tasks
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Research MCP client libraries and pick one
  - Evaluate official MCP clients
  - Check community implementations
  - Test basic connectivity before committing
- [ ] Investigate Intercom MCP endpoint details and authentication
- [ ] Study MCP protocol specifications for conversation data
- [ ] Research MCP error handling best practices

### External Dependencies
- [ ] MCP library availability and stability
- [ ] Intercom MCP server documentation
- [ ] OAuth flow requirements for MCP

## ðŸ”„ Parallel Work (Can do anytime, independent tasks)

### Architecture Preparation
- [ ] Design interfaces for future multi-MCP support
- [ ] Create `src/mcp_registry.py` skeleton for Phase 1
- [ ] Plan cross-platform context management patterns
- [ ] Document Universal Agent interface designs

### Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor existing code for better MCP integration
- [ ] Add type hints for MCP-related code
- [ ] Improve error handling throughout codebase
- [ ] Clean up existing REST API client code

### Testing Infrastructure  
- [ ] Set up mocking for MCP client tests
- [ ] Create test data for MCP responses
- [ ] Build integration test environment
- [ ] Add performance regression testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Selection Strategy

**High Energy Day**: Tackle MCP authentication or complex architecture work  
**Medium Energy**: Work on integration points or data transformation  
**Low Energy**: Configuration updates, tests, or documentation  
**Blocked on Research**: Work on parallel tasks or switch to web deployment branch

**Remember**: You can always switch to web deployment work if MCP tasks feel blocked or you want variety!
