# Phase 0.5 MCP Integration Progress

> **Current status and what's next** - update after each session

## 🔥 Current Vibe
**Working on**: Documentation restructure → Ready to start MCP implementation  
**Next**: Pick MCP client library and start basic connection  
**Blocked on**: Nothing - ready to code!  

## 📊 Overall Progress
- **Planning**: ✅ Complete
- **Research**: 🔄 Need to pick MCP library
- **Implementation**: ⏳ Not started
- **Testing**: ⏳ Not started
- **Benchmarking**: ⏳ Not started

## ✅ Recently Completed
- ✅ Created comprehensive MCP integration plan
- ✅ Decided on dual-mode architecture (REST + MCP)
- ✅ Designed Universal Agent preparation interfaces
- ✅ Organized tasks by energy level and complexity
- ✅ Set up new documentation structure

## 🔄 Currently Working On
- Documentation restructure (almost done)
- Planning Phase 0.5 + Web deployment parallel work

## 🎯 Next Session Plans

### Immediate Next Steps (Pick one based on energy)
1. **Research Session**: Evaluate MCP client libraries and pick one
2. **Quick Setup**: Add MCP config fields to `src/config.py`
3. **Alternative**: Switch to web deployment work for variety

### Upcoming This Week
- Start MCP client foundation
- Create basic connection management
- Add dual-mode operation to existing client

## 🚧 Discovered Issues & Learnings
- Need to research MCP library ecosystem before implementation
- Authentication might be more complex than expected
- Performance testing will be crucial to validate MCP benefits
- Web deployment can run in parallel on separate branch

## 🧠 Technical Notes
- Keep REST API as proven fallback during MCP development
- Design MCP interfaces with future multi-platform support in mind
- Focus on <10s response time as primary success metric
- Architecture preparation for Universal Agent is equally important as performance

## ⚡ Energy & Context
- **High energy tasks**: MCP authentication, complex architecture
- **Medium energy tasks**: Config updates, integration points
- **Low energy tasks**: Documentation, tests, cleanup
- **Parallel option**: Web deployment work when wanting variety
