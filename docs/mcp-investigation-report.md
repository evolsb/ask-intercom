# Intercom MCP Investigation Report

**Date:** June 21, 2025  
**Status:** Investigation Complete  
**Recommendation:** Stick with REST API

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive testing of Intercom's Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation, we've determined that **Intercom's MCP is non-functional** for production use. While authentication and basic connection establishment work, the protocol does not deliver responses to requests.

## Investigation Methodology

We conducted extensive testing using:
1. **Connection Testing**: SSE establishment and session management
2. **Protocol Testing**: JSON-RPC message formats and methods
3. **Response Pattern Analysis**: Various approaches to receive responses
4. **Alternative Protocol Testing**: WebSocket, HTTP polling, different endpoints
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Against working REST API

## Detailed Findings

### ‚úÖ What Works
- **OAuth 2.1 Authentication**: Token loading and validation
- **SSE Connection Establishment**: Initial connection succeeds
- **Session Endpoint Discovery**: Dynamic session URLs generated
- **Request Acceptance**: All JSON-RPC requests return `202 Accepted`

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work
- **Response Delivery**: No responses received via any mechanism
- **SSE Persistence**: Connections close immediately after endpoint event
- **Tool Execution**: No functional tools despite acceptance
- **Session Persistence**: Session endpoints return `404` on subsequent requests

### üî¨ Technical Details

#### SSE Behavior
```
1. Client ‚Üí GET /sse ‚Üí SSE connection opens
2. Server ‚Üí SSE: "endpoint" event with session URL
3. Connection immediately closes (0.0s duration)
4. No further events delivered
```

#### Request/Response Pattern
```
1. Client ‚Üí POST /sse/message?sessionId=X ‚Üí 202 Accepted
2. Expected: Response via SSE stream
3. Actual: No response, SSE connection dead
```

#### Tested Methods
All standard MCP methods return `202 Accepted` but no responses:
- `initialize`
- `tools/list`
- `tools/call`
- `resources/list`
- `prompts/list`

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | REST API | MCP |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Connection** | ‚úÖ Reliable | ‚úÖ Establishes |
| **Authentication** | ‚úÖ Works | ‚úÖ Works |
| **Request Handling** | ‚úÖ Functional | ‚ùå No responses |
| **Tool Execution** | ‚úÖ search_conversations works | ‚ùå No tools work |
| **Response Time** | ~2-5 seconds | ‚àû (timeout) |
| **Reliability** | 99%+ | 0% |

## Business Impact Analysis

### If We Proceed with MCP
- **Risk**: Complete system failure - no data retrieval possible
- **User Impact**: Application becomes non-functional
- **Development Cost**: Wasted effort on non-working protocol
- **Timeline**: Indefinite delay waiting for Intercom to fix MCP

### If We Stick with REST
- **Risk**: Minimal - proven, stable API
- **User Impact**: Continued reliable service
- **Development Cost**: Zero additional work
- **Timeline**: Can focus on features instead of protocol debugging

## Alternative Approaches Tested

1. **Fresh SSE per Request**: Failed - connections still terminate
2. **WebSocket Alternative**: Rejected by server (`HTTP 405`)
3. **HTTP Polling**: Session endpoints return `404`
4. **Different Message Formats**: All return `202` but no responses
5. **Persistent Connections**: SSE streams close immediately

## Conclusions

### Technical Assessment
Intercom's MCP implementation is **incomplete or experimental**:
- Authentication layer is functional
- Protocol framework exists but is non-operational
- No evidence of actual tool execution or response delivery
- Behavior suggests beta/experimental status

### Strategic Recommendation

**STICK WITH REST API** for the following reasons:

1. **Reliability**: REST API is proven and stable
2. **Functionality**: All required features work correctly
3. **Performance**: Acceptable response times (2-5s)
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid betting on non-functional technology
5. **Focus**: Spend development time on features, not debugging protocols

### Future Considerations

**Monitor Intercom's MCP Development:**
- Check for official MCP availability announcements
- Test periodically (quarterly) for functionality improvements
- Consider migration when MCP proves stable and offers benefits

**Current MCP Infrastructure Value:**
- Keep existing MCP code as foundation for future migration
- Use as adapter pattern for other platforms (Slack, Linear)
- Demonstrates architectural flexibility for stakeholders

## Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate (v0.4)**: Remove MCP from critical path, focus on REST optimization
2. **Short-term**: Document MCP limitations for future teams
3. **Medium-term**: Monitor Intercom MCP status quarterly
4. **Long-term**: Evaluate migration when MCP becomes functional

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Cost of Continuing MCP Development
- **Development Time**: 2-3 weeks debugging non-functional protocol
- **Opportunity Cost**: Features not built while debugging MCP
- **Risk**: Application reliability depends on experimental technology
- **User Impact**: Potential service interruptions

### Benefit of REST Focus
- **Immediate Value**: Reliable data access for users
- **Development Velocity**: Focus on features users want
- **System Stability**: Proven technology reduces risk
- **User Satisfaction**: Consistent, reliable service delivery

## Final Recommendation

**ABANDON MCP INTEGRATION** for production use. Intercom's MCP implementation is not ready for production workloads. 

**PRIORITIZE REST API OPTIMIZATION** to deliver immediate value to users while monitoring MCP development for future opportunities.
