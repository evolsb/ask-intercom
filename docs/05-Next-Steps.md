# Next Steps

> **Planned improvements and future direction**

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (v0.4)

### Priority Track A: MCP + Universal Agent (High Priority)
**Goal**: Foundation for multi-platform intelligence
- **MCP integration**: Implement Model Context Protocol for performance and extensibility
- **Universal agent architecture**: Modular skills-based system
- **Performance optimization**: <30 second response times via MCP
- **Multi-platform foundation**: Architecture prep for Slack, Linear, etc.

### Parallel Track B: Deployment & Infrastructure
**Goal**: Make it accessible and scalable
- **Docker containerization**: Single-command deployment
- **Hosted version**: Deploy to cloud with usage analytics
- **GitHub polish**: Better README, examples, contribution guide
- **Production monitoring**: Error tracking and performance metrics

## 🚀 Medium-term Vision (v0.5-v1.0)

### v0.5: Enhanced User Experience
**Goal**: Bring CLI features to web + improve usability
- **Follow-up questions**: Port CLI's conversation memory to web interface
- **Drill-down analysis**: "Tell me more about verification issues" 
- **UI improvements**: Streamline API key entry into Settings modal
- **Better onboarding**: Guided setup and example queries
- **Export functionality**: CSV/PDF reports, shareable insights

### v0.6: Multi-platform Intelligence  
**Goal**: Expand beyond Intercom using universal agent foundation
- **Slack integration**: Analyze team discussions about customers
- **Linear integration**: Connect customer feedback to product decisions
- **Cross-platform queries**: "What customer issues are blocking our roadmap?"
- **Context management**: Maintain state across platforms

## 📋 Decision Points

### Current Priority Decision
**MCP + Universal Agent first** because:
- Foundation for all future multi-platform work
- Performance improvements benefit current users
- Architectural investment pays dividends later

**Deployment in parallel** because:
- Can work independently of MCP development  
- Makes current functionality accessible to more users
- Provides feedback loop for prioritizing features

### Success Metrics
- **v0.4**: MCP working + <30 second response times + deployed app
- **v0.5**: Follow-up questions working + streamlined UI
- **v0.6**: Multi-platform queries functional

## 🛣️ Longer-term Roadmap

### v1.0: Universal Agent Platform
- Full multi-platform support (Intercom + Slack + Linear)
- Skills marketplace and plugin system
- Enterprise features and team collaboration

### v2.0: Intelligence Marketplace
- Deploy to Claude Apps, GPT Store
- White-label platform options
- Advanced analytics and reporting

### v3.0: Predictive Platform
- Predictive insights and recommendations
- Integration ecosystem and API platform
- AI-driven workflow automation

## 🎮 Development Approach

### Principles
- **User-driven**: Build what people actually need
- **Quality first**: Each version should be solid before adding more
- **Simple by default**: Complex features should be optional
- **Open source**: Community contributions and transparency

### Next Session Planning
1. **Choose direction**: Performance, Deployment, or Features
2. **Set measurable goals**: Clear success criteria
3. **Time-box effort**: Limit scope to maintain momentum  
4. **Get user feedback**: Validate direction early

## 🤔 Open Questions

- **Performance**: Are current response times acceptable for the value provided?
- **Market fit**: Is Intercom analysis the right starting point, or should we go multi-platform sooner?
- **Architecture**: Should we invest in MCP now or later?
- **Business model**: Open source with hosted option, or SaaS from the start?

## 💡 Ideas for Later

- **AI model options**: Support for Claude, local models, etc.
- **Advanced filtering**: Sentiment analysis, customer segments, etc.
- **Automation**: Scheduled reports, alert systems
- **Integrations**: Zapier, webhooks, API access
- **Team features**: Shared insights, collaboration tools
