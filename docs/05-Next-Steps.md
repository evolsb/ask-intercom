# Next Steps

> **Planned improvements and future direction**

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (v0.4 - In Progress)

### Phase 1: Docker Experience ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Bulletproof one-command deployment for developers
- ✅ **Docker setup complete**: Multi-stage build with health checks and security
- ✅ **End-to-end tested**: Full deployment validation with real Docker daemon
- ✅ **Build issues resolved**: Frontend TypeScript and Poetry 2.x compatibility fixed
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with automated Docker testing
- ✅ **Documentation updated**: Clear README and setup guide  
- ✅ **Environment template**: Comprehensive .env.example
- ✅ **Developer workflow**: `git clone` → `cp .env.example .env` → `docker-compose up` → working app

### Phase 2: Railway Deployment ✅ **DECIDED**
**Goal**: Enable hosted SaaS for non-technical users
- ✅ **Platform decision**: Railway selected for developer experience + agent marketplace alignment
- **Deployment pipeline**: GitHub → Railway automatic deployment using existing Docker setup
- **Production instance**: Get first hosted version live for user testing
- **Hosted features**: Landing page, usage analytics, enhanced UI
- **Production monitoring**: Railway's built-in metrics + error tracking
- **Template marketplace**: Create Railway template for discoverability

## 🚀 Medium-term Vision (v0.5-v1.0)

### v0.5: Enhanced User Experience 
**Goal**: Improve usability based on user feedback from deployed versions
- **Follow-up questions**: Port CLI's conversation memory to web interface
- **Drill-down analysis**: "Tell me more about verification issues"
- **Export functionality**: CSV/PDF reports, shareable insights  
- **Usage analytics**: Track popular queries and optimize performance
- **Better onboarding**: Guided setup with example queries

### v0.6: Performance & Scale
**Goal**: Handle larger user base and improve response times
- **MCP integration**: Model Context Protocol for faster queries (<30s target)
- **Caching layer**: Cache frequently accessed conversations
- **Rate limiting**: Smart throttling for hosted version
- **Enterprise features**: Team collaboration, custom branding

### v0.7: Multi-platform Intelligence
**Goal**: Expand beyond Intercom (post-MVP)
- **Slack integration**: Analyze team discussions about customers  
- **Linear integration**: Connect customer feedback to product decisions
- **Cross-platform queries**: "What customer issues are blocking our roadmap?"
- **Universal agent**: Skills-based architecture for extensibility

## 📋 Railway Deployment Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1. **Railway Setup**:
   - Sign up for Railway account with GitHub integration
   - Use $5 trial credit for initial deployment
   - Connect ask-intercom repository

2. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Create Railway project from Docker template
   - Configure environment variables from .env.example
   - Set up automatic deployments from main branch
   - Configure custom domain (optional)

3. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Deploy existing Docker setup
   - Verify API endpoints working
   - Test real-time progress features
   - Monitor performance metrics

4. **Template Creation**:
   - Package as Railway template
   - Add to Railway marketplace
   - Include setup documentation

### Why Railway Was Chosen
- **Agent marketplace alignment**: Enterprise-grade scaling (112 vCPU/2TB RAM)
- **Developer experience**: Project Canvas, auto PR environments, built-in DB UI
- **Template marketplace**: Discovery channel for developers
- **Security & compliance**: Built-in secrets management for API keys
- **Cost structure**: Pay-as-you-go aligns with variable agent workloads
- **Future-proof**: Container-first architecture ready for multi-LLM support

### Success Metrics
- **v0.4**: Docker deployment working + cloud platform chosen + hosted app live
- **v0.5**: Follow-up questions working + streamlined UI  
- **v0.6**: Multi-platform queries functional

## 🛣️ Longer-term Roadmap

### v1.0: Universal Agent Platform
- Full multi-platform support (Intercom + Slack + Linear)
- Skills marketplace and plugin system
- Enterprise features and team collaboration

### v2.0: Intelligence Marketplace
- Deploy to Claude Apps, GPT Store
- White-label platform options
- Advanced analytics and reporting

### v3.0: Predictive Platform
- Predictive insights and recommendations
- Integration ecosystem and API platform
- AI-driven workflow automation

## 🎮 Development Approach

### Principles
- **User-driven**: Build what people actually need
- **Quality first**: Each version should be solid before adding more
- **Simple by default**: Complex features should be optional
- **Open source**: Community contributions and transparency

### Immediate Next Session Planning
1. ✅ **Railway deployment**: Live at https://ask-intercom-production.up.railway.app/
2. **Template marketplace**: Package and submit to Railway templates
3. **User testing**: Share hosted URL with target personas for feedback
4. **Performance monitoring**: Use Railway metrics and remote debugging tools

### 🔧 Remote Debugging (Production)
**Critical for monitoring live deployment:**
- **Live logs**: `railway logs | grep -i "error\|json\|parse"`
- **Web logs API**: `GET https://ask-intercom-production.up.railway.app/api/logs?lines=100`
- **Debug status**: `GET https://ask-intercom-production.up.railway.app/api/debug`
- **Health check**: `GET https://ask-intercom-production.up.railway.app/api/health`

**Common Issues to Monitor:**
- JSON parsing failures ("Failed to parse structured response")
- API rate limits or authentication errors
- Performance degradation (response times > 2 minutes)
- Memory/resource issues in Railway dashboard

## 🤔 Open Questions

- **Performance**: Are current response times acceptable for the value provided?
- **Market fit**: Is Intercom analysis the right starting point, or should we go multi-platform sooner?
- **Architecture**: Should we invest in MCP now or later?
- **Business model**: Open source with hosted option, or SaaS from the start?

## 💡 Ideas for Later

- **AI model options**: Support for Claude, local models, etc.
- **Advanced filtering**: Sentiment analysis, customer segments, etc.
- **Automation**: Scheduled reports, alert systems
- **Integrations**: Zapier, webhooks, API access
- **Team features**: Shared insights, collaboration tools
