# Next Steps

> **Planned improvements and future direction**

## ✅ v0.4 - COMPLETED (June 21, 2025)

**All pre-merge requirements completed and merged to main:**
- ✅ JSON parsing robustness with comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ React error boundaries with user-friendly error UI
- ✅ Real performance metrics reading from log data
- ✅ Enhanced code quality and integration testing

## 🎯 Current Work: v0.5 Conversational UI & Follow-up Questions (In Progress)

**Current Status**: Major UI redesign for conversational experience

### **NEW PLAN: Conversational Interface (June 22, 2025)**

#### Phase 1: Backend Response Format Changes ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Enable rich conversational responses with customer references
- ✅ **Session state management**: Full backend/frontend session handling
- ✅ **Follow-up detection**: Pattern matching for conversational queries
- ✅ **Conversation context**: Reuse previous conversations for follow-ups
- 🚧 **Rich text responses**: Modify follow-up responses to include conversation IDs naturally

#### Phase 2: Conversational UI Architecture (In Progress)
**Goal**: Transform from structured cards to chat-like experience
- ✅ **Frontend store fixes**: Resolved React hook errors, unified Zustand store
- 🚧 **Chat interface**: Add conversational flow after initial structured response
- ❌ **Response format switching**: Structured cards → free text for follow-ups
- ❌ **Customer link detection**: Parse emails in responses, create interactive elements
- ❌ **Card collapse**: Initial cards collapse when chat begins

#### Phase 3: Interactive Customer References (Not Started)
**Goal**: Clickable customer references with actions
- ❌ **Rich text parsing**: Detect emails/conversation IDs in AI responses
- ❌ **Customer components**: Hover popups with Copy/Open actions
- ❌ **Conversation linking**: Direct links to Intercom conversations
- ❌ **Reset functionality**: Clear conversation, start fresh

#### Phase 4: Chat Experience Polish (Not Started)
**Goal**: Clean, minimal, conversational interface
- ❌ **Chat styling**: Light, airy design for conversation flow
- ❌ **Session management**: Prominent but subtle reset functionality
- ❌ **Response enhancement**: Ensure AI includes conversation references naturally
- ❌ **Future features**: Save conversations, multiple chat sessions

### **Technical Approach:**
- **Rich text parsing**: AI returns natural text, frontend parses for interactive elements
- **Customer detection**: Email patterns converted to React components with hover actions
- **Conversation flow**: Initial query → structured cards → conversational chat interface
- **Session scope**: One conversation thread per session with reset capability
- **Response format**: Structured insights first, then free-text follow-ups with customer references

### Phase 2: Railway Deployment ✅ **DECIDED**
**Goal**: Enable hosted SaaS for non-technical users
- ✅ **Platform decision**: Railway selected for developer experience + agent marketplace alignment
- **Deployment pipeline**: GitHub → Railway automatic deployment using existing Docker setup
- **Production instance**: Get first hosted version live for user testing
- **Hosted features**: Landing page, usage analytics, enhanced UI
- **Production monitoring**: Railway's built-in metrics + error tracking
- **Template marketplace**: Create Railway template for discoverability

## 🚀 Medium-term Vision (v0.5-v1.0)

### v0.5: Enhanced User Experience 
**Goal**: Improve usability based on user feedback from deployed versions
- **Follow-up questions**: Port CLI's conversation memory to web interface
- **Drill-down analysis**: "Tell me more about verification issues"
- **Export functionality**: CSV/PDF reports, shareable insights  
- **Usage analytics**: Track popular queries and optimize performance
- **Better onboarding**: Guided setup with example queries

### v0.6: Performance & Scale
**Goal**: Handle larger user base and improve response times
- **MCP integration**: Model Context Protocol for faster queries (<30s target)
- **Caching layer**: Cache frequently accessed conversations
- **Rate limiting**: Smart throttling for hosted version
- **Enterprise features**: Team collaboration, custom branding

### v0.7: Multi-platform Intelligence
**Goal**: Expand beyond Intercom (post-MVP)
- **Slack integration**: Analyze team discussions about customers  
- **Linear integration**: Connect customer feedback to product decisions
- **Cross-platform queries**: "What customer issues are blocking our roadmap?"
- **Universal agent**: Skills-based architecture for extensibility

## 📋 Railway Deployment Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1. **Railway Setup**:
   - Sign up for Railway account with GitHub integration
   - Use $5 trial credit for initial deployment
   - Connect ask-intercom repository

2. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Create Railway project from Docker template
   - Configure environment variables from .env.example
   - Set up automatic deployments from main branch
   - Configure custom domain (optional)

3. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Deploy existing Docker setup
   - Verify API endpoints working
   - Test real-time progress features
   - Monitor performance metrics

4. **Template Creation**:
   - Package as Railway template
   - Add to Railway marketplace

## 🎮 Development Approach

### Principles
- **User-driven**: Build what people actually need
- **Quality first**: Each version should be solid before adding more
- **Simple by default**: Complex features should be optional
- **Open source**: Community contributions and transparency

### Immediate Next Session Planning
1. ✅ **Railway deployment**: Live at https://ask-intercom-production.up.railway.app/
2. **Pre-merge tasks** (HIGH PRIORITY):
   - Test JSON parsing fix with real query on live app
   - Add unit tests for structured JSON parsing
   - Add error boundaries to React frontend
   - Add basic performance metrics collection
   - Verify all improvements work end-to-end
3. **Post-merge tasks** (MEDIUM PRIORITY):
   - Create Railway template for marketplace
   - User testing and feedback collection
   - Performance monitoring dashboard

### 🔧 Remote Debugging (Production)
**Critical for monitoring live deployment:**
- **Live logs**: `railway logs | grep -i "error\|json\|parse"`
- **Web logs API**: `GET https://ask-intercom-production.up.railway.app/api/logs?lines=100`
- **Debug status**: `GET https://ask-intercom-production.up.railway.app/api/debug`
- **Health check**: `GET https://ask-intercom-production.up.railway.app/api/health`

**Common Issues to Monitor:**
- JSON parsing failures ("Failed to parse structured response")
- API rate limits or authentication errors
- Performance degradation (response times > 2 minutes)
- Memory/resource issues in Railway dashboard

## 🤔 Open Questions

- **Performance**: Are current response times acceptable for the value provided?
- **Market fit**: Is Intercom analysis the right starting point, or should we go multi-platform sooner?
- **Architecture**: Should we invest in MCP now or later?
- **Business model**: Open source with hosted option, or SaaS from the start?

## 💡 Ideas for Later

- **AI model options**: Support for Claude, local models, etc.
- **Advanced filtering**: Sentiment analysis, customer segments, etc.
- **Automation**: Scheduled reports, alert systems
- **Integrations**: Zapier, webhooks, API access
- **Team features**: Shared insights, collaboration tools
