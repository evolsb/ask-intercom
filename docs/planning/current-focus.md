## 🔥 Active Work: Phase 0.5 Parallel Development

**Two parallel tracks** - choose based on what needs to be de-risked next!

### 🚀 Track A: MCP Integration
**Goal**: <10 second response time + Universal Agent foundation  
**Branch**: `main` or `feature/mcp-integration`  
**Focus**: Performance optimization, architecture foundation

### 🌐 Track B: Web Deployment  
**Goal**: Transform CLI into shareable web app  
**Branch**: `feature/web-deployment`  
**Focus**: User accessibility, rapid feedback loops

### 🎯 Current Session Focus
🔄 **Working on**: UI/UX improvements and testing  
🎯 **Next**: Gather user feedback on improved interface, consider additional polish  
✅ **Completed**: Major UI redesign with card-based layout and dark mode fixes  

### 🧠 Mental Context
- Phase 0 CLI prototype complete (30.2s response time)
- Web app fully functional with professional, modern interface
- Card-based analysis results with category-specific styling and icons
- Dark mode contrast issues resolved for better readability
- Clean conversation link display with external link buttons
- Ready for user testing and feedback gathering

### 🚧 Priority Order

1. **Critical Debugging Infrastructure** (solve immediate user issues)
   - Structured logging with session IDs
   - Environment validation and health checks
   - Claude integration for instant debugging
   - Enhanced error handling and display
   
2. **MCP Integration** (de-risk performance)
   - Implement MCP client
   - Compare performance vs REST
   - Keep REST as fallback

3. **Production Features** (iterate based on feedback)
   - Advanced analytics and learning
   - Export capabilities
   - Federated learning preparation

## 📋 What's Coming After This Focus

**Phase 1**: Universal Agent Skills Architecture
- Transform monolithic CLI into pluggable skills
- Enable multi-MCP platform support (Slack, Linear)
- Cross-platform intelligence queries
