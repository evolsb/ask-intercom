## 🔥 Active Work: Phase 0.5 Parallel Development

**Two parallel tracks** - choose based on what needs to be de-risked next!

### 🚀 Track A: MCP Integration
**Goal**: <10 second response time + Universal Agent foundation  
**Branch**: `main` or `feature/mcp-integration`  
**Focus**: Performance optimization, architecture foundation

### 🌐 Track B: Web Deployment  
**Goal**: Transform CLI into shareable web app  
**Branch**: `feature/web-deployment`  
**Focus**: User accessibility, rapid feedback loops

### 🎯 Current Session Focus
🔄 **Working on**: Critical logging and debugging infrastructure  
🎯 **Next**: Implement session management, structured logging, and Claude integration tools  
✅ **Completed**: Web MVP deployment with React+Vite frontend and FastAPI backend  

### 🧠 Mental Context
- Phase 0 CLI prototype complete (30.2s response time)
- Web MVP deployed but needs critical debugging infrastructure
- User experiencing errors that can't be easily diagnosed
- Priority: Structured logging, session management, and Claude debugging tools
- Architecture foundation solid, now need operational visibility

### 🚧 Priority Order

1. **Critical Debugging Infrastructure** (solve immediate user issues)
   - Structured logging with session IDs
   - Environment validation and health checks
   - Claude integration for instant debugging
   - Enhanced error handling and display
   
2. **MCP Integration** (de-risk performance)
   - Implement MCP client
   - Compare performance vs REST
   - Keep REST as fallback

3. **Production Features** (iterate based on feedback)
   - Advanced analytics and learning
   - Export capabilities
   - Federated learning preparation

## 📋 What's Coming After This Focus

**Phase 1**: Universal Agent Skills Architecture
- Transform monolithic CLI into pluggable skills
- Enable multi-MCP platform support (Slack, Linear)
- Cross-platform intelligence queries
