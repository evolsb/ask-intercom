## 🔥 Active Work: Phase 0.5 Parallel Development

**Two parallel tracks** - choose based on what needs to be de-risked next!

### 🚀 Track A: MCP Integration
**Goal**: <10 second response time + Universal Agent foundation  
**Branch**: `main` or `feature/mcp-integration`  
**Focus**: Performance optimization, architecture foundation

### 🌐 Track B: Web Deployment  
**Goal**: Transform CLI into shareable web app  
**Branch**: `feature/web-deployment`  
**Focus**: User accessibility, rapid feedback loops

### 🎯 Current Session Focus
🔄 **Working on**: Documentation cleanup and technical decisions  
🎯 **Next**: Start web deployment implementation with React + Vite  
✅ **Completed**: Framework decisions (React+Vite, SSE, localStorage auth)  

### 🧠 Mental Context
- Phase 0 CLI prototype complete (30.2s response time)
- Architecture decisions made: Universal Agent, React+Vite, SSE, comprehensive logging
- Ready to start web implementation with clear technical direction
- Both tracks can proceed independently

### 🚧 Priority Order

1. **Web MVP** (de-risk user access)
   - FastAPI wrapper around CLI
   - React + Vite frontend with SSE
   - Docker deployment ready
   
2. **MCP Integration** (de-risk performance)
   - Implement MCP client
   - Compare performance vs REST
   - Keep REST as fallback

3. **Production Features** (iterate based on feedback)
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Export capabilities
   - Analytics dashboard

## 📋 What's Coming After This Focus

**Phase 1**: Universal Agent Skills Architecture
- Transform monolithic CLI into pluggable skills
- Enable multi-MCP platform support (Slack, Linear)
- Cross-platform intelligence queries
