## 🔥 Active Work: Phase 0.5 Parallel Development

**Two parallel tracks** - choose based on what needs to be de-risked next!

### 🚀 Track A: MCP Integration
**Goal**: <10 second response time + Universal Agent foundation  
**Branch**: `main` or `feature/mcp-integration`  
**Focus**: Performance optimization, architecture foundation

### 🌐 Track B: Web Deployment  
**Goal**: Transform CLI into shareable web app  
**Branch**: `feature/web-deployment`  
**Focus**: User accessibility, rapid feedback loops

### 🎯 Current Session Focus
🔄 **Working on**: Major AI output restructuring with JSON schema  
🎯 **Next**: Implement structured JSON output from AI → replace text parsing  
✅ **Completed This Session**: 
- Complete shadcn UI redesign with proper layout consistency
- Fixed card implementation with proper titles and typography
- Added copy-to-clipboard functionality with elegant split buttons
- Unified layout - all results now in single main Card container
- Removed duplicate insights section (was 1:1 with detail cards)
- Fixed max conversations input (proper text input, no increment buttons)
- Made entire card headers clickable for expand/collapse
- Customer emails now used as button text instead of "View Conversation X"
- Combined view/copy buttons with "|" divider design  

### 🧠 Mental Context
- Phase 0 CLI prototype complete (30.2s response time)
- Web app UI redesign complete with clean shadcn implementation
- **Critical Issue**: Current text parsing is fragile - 140+ lines of regex trying to extract structure
- **Next Major Update**: Structured JSON output from AI to eliminate parsing issues
- Cards show title duplication in body (caused by parsing problems)
- AI will return JSON schema instead of markdown text for reliable data extraction

### 🚧 Priority Order

1. **IMMEDIATE: Structured AI Output** (eliminates current parsing issues)
   - Implement JSON schema for AI responses
   - Replace 140+ lines of fragile regex parsing  
   - Direct data consumption in frontend
   - Simple try/catch fallback to current approach (temporary)
   
2. **Enhanced Real-time Progress** (user experience)
   - Granular progress updates via SSE
   - "Fetched X/Y conversations", "Consulting AI..." feedback
   - Real-time progress bar movement

3. **Production Polish** (after core functionality solid)
   - Advanced debugging infrastructure
   - MCP integration for performance  
   - Export capabilities and analytics

## 📋 What's Coming After This Focus

**Phase 1**: Universal Agent Skills Architecture
- Transform monolithic CLI into pluggable skills
- Enable multi-MCP platform support (Slack, Linear)
- Cross-platform intelligence queries
