## 🔥 Active Work: Phase 0.5 Parallel Development

**Two parallel tracks** - switch between them based on energy and mood!

### 🚀 Track A: MCP Integration
**Goal**: <10 second response time + Universal Agent foundation  
**Branch**: `main` or `feature/mcp-integration`  
**Energy**: Research-heavy, architecture focus

### 🌐 Track B: Web Deployment  
**Goal**: Transform CLI into shareable web app  
**Branch**: `feature/web-deployment`  
**Energy**: UI/UX work, immediate user value

### 🎯 Current Session Focus
🔄 **Working on**: Setting up new documentation structure  
🎯 **Next**: Pick a track based on energy - MCP research OR web frontend  
🚧 **Blocked on**: Nothing - ready to code on either track!  

### 🧠 Mental Context
- Just finished major documentation restructure for Universal Agent
- Phase 0 CLI prototype is complete and working (30.2s response time)
- Need MCP integration to hit <10s target and enable future multi-platform work
- Architecture decision made: Universal Agent with pluggable skills

### ⚡ Energy Level Guide

#### 🟢 High Energy (Deep focus work)
- **MCP Track**: Authentication implementation, complex architecture design
- **Web Track**: FastAPI backend integration, React frontend architecture

#### 🟡 Medium Energy (Steady progress)  
- **MCP Track**: Config updates, integration points, basic connection setup
- **Web Track**: UI components, styling, form handling

#### 🔴 Low Energy (Easy wins)
- **MCP Track**: Documentation, tests, config file updates
- **Web Track**: Static pages, copy writing, simple styling tweaks

#### 🎮 Variety Mode
Switch tracks when you want a change of pace - frontend work vs backend research feels different!

## 📋 What's Coming After This Focus

**Phase 1**: Universal Agent Skills Architecture
- Transform current monolithic CLI into pluggable skills
- Prepare for multi-MCP platform support
- Enable cross-platform context management
